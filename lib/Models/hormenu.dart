          ingredients: "For the Dosa Batter:\n1 cup regular rice (not basmati)\n1/2 cup urad dal (split black lentils)\n1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional, for fermentation)\nWater (for soaking and grinding)\nSalt to taste\n\nFor Making Dosas:\nDosa batter\nOil or ghee (clarified butter) for cooking\nOptional fillings: chopped onions, chopped tomatoes, grated cheese, etc. (as desired)",
          decription: "Preparing the Dosa Batter:\n1. Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds (if using) separately under running water.\n2. Soak the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds in enough water for at least 4-6 hours. You can soak them overnight for convenience.\n3. After soaking, drain the water from the rice and urad dal separately.\n4. Grind the rice and urad dal separately to a smooth paste using a blender or wet grinder. You can add a little water as needed while grinding.\n5. Mix the ground rice and urad dal batter together in a large bowl. Add salt and mix well.\n6. Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours or overnight. The batter will rise and become slightly airy.\n7. Once fermented, mix the batter gently, and it's ready to be used for making dosas.\n\nMaking Dosas:\n1. Heat a dosa tawa (flat griddle) or a non-stick skillet on medium heat.\n2. Once the tawa is hot, take a ladleful of dosa batter and pour it onto the center of the tawa.\n3. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. You can make the dosa as small or as large as you prefer.\n4. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa and a few drops on top.\n5. Cook the dosa on medium heat until the bottom turns golden brown and crisp.\n6. Add any desired fillings like chopped onions, tomatoes, or grated cheese on the dosa.\n7. Gently fold the dosa over the fillings to form a half-moon shape or roll it up like a wrap.\n8. Cook for another minute or so until the fillings are heated through and any cheese has melted.\n9. Remove the dosa from the tawa and repeat the process with the remaining batter.\n10. Serve hot dosas with sambar, coconut chutney, or any chutney of your choice."),
